## available_feature

It's possible to
- List Duplicate Entries on HBI/Insights Inventory
- List Servers with different `display_name` and `Hostname`
- List Server with Last_Seen > X days
- List all the Hypervisors with at least 1 guest
- Remove entries on console.redhat.com

Those information will be very useful during the troubleshooting process.

## running_with_venv

First, let's create the virtual environment using python 3.6
```
# python3.6 -m venv ~/.virtualenv/hbi-axe
```
Now let's clone the project and access the directory
```
# git clone https://github.com/waldirio/c.rh.c-tools.git
# cd c.rh.c-tools/hbi-axe/
```
At this moment, let's activate the virtual environment
```
# source ~/.virtualenv/hbi-axe/bin/activate
(hbi-axe) [root@wallsat69 hbi-axe]#
```
This step will be necessary just once, we will upgrade the pip
```
(hbi-axe) [root@wallsat69 hbi-axe]# pip install --upgrade pip
```
and install some requirements. Don't worry, this will be real quick and will not change your environment, everything will be installed under the virtual environment `hbi-axe`
```
(hbi-axe) [root@wallsat69 hbi-axe]# pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Great. Now, we are ready to go! As you can see below, you can pass the username and password.
```
(hbi-axe) [root@wallsat69 hbi-axe]# ./hbi-axe.py 
Must specify at least login.  See usage:
Usage: hbi-axe.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOGIN, --login=LOGIN
                        Login user
  -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
                        Password for specified user. Will prompt if omitted
  -s SERVER, --server=SERVER
                        FQDN of server - omit https://

Example usage: ./hbi-axe.py -l username
(hbi-axe) [root@wallsat69 hbi-axe]#
```
Once you pass only the username, the password will be requested and here we are!
```
(hbi-axe) [root@wallsat69 hbi-axe]# ./hbi-axe.py -l user-account-here
user-account-here's password:
